# EggOS
AI-native operating system written from scratch in Rust, including its own Linux-compatible kernel; runs Windows, macOS and Android apps; personal, professional, enterprise and server editions.

100% open source under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Layout
| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `kernel/` | architecture-independent kernel core and the kernel binary |
| `hal/` | hardware abstraction layer: the `Platform` trait and one module per architecture |
| `drivers/` | device drivers behind one driver model |
| `xtask/` | developer commands (`cargo xtask ...`) |
| `docs/` | [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), [decisions](docs/decisions.md), [dependencies](docs/dependencies.md), [UX research](docs/ux/README.md) |

## Build and test
Requires [rustup](https://rustup.rs); the pinned toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` installs itself.

```
cargo xtask ci        # everything CI runs: fmt, clippy, tests
```
