# Architecture decisions

Numbered, append-only. A later decision may supersede an earlier one; say so in both entries.
Status is **Decided** (owner) or **Provisional, owner to confirm**.

## D1 Kernel: our own, in Rust, Linux-compatible — Decided
We write our own kernel in Rust; no Linux kernel C code. "Linux-compatible" means the kernel
implements the Linux interfaces (system calls, ABI, `/proc`/`/sys` conventions where needed) so
unmodified Linux software runs on it.

## D2 Compatibility layers: Linux userland first — Provisional, owner to confirm
Windows, macOS and Android apps run through compatibility layers we write, with the same features
on each. The owner has not chosen which comes first. Provisional order:
1. **Linux userland** — the kernel's native ABI (D1), so it is not a separate layer so much as the
   foundation every other layer needs (process model, files, signals, mmap, threads).
2. **Android** — Android apps run on a Linux ABI plus Binder, ashmem and the ART runtime, so it
   reuses almost all of step 1.
3. **Windows** (PE loader, NT syscalls/Win32 on top of our kernel) and **macOS** (Mach-O loader,
   XNU/Mach traps, frameworks), order between them to be decided once the Linux layer is solid.
Reasoning: nothing else can run before the Linux ABI exists, and each step reuses the previous one.

## D3 AI-native interface — Decided (shape to be designed)
The OS exposes its capabilities (files, processes, settings, devices, UI) to AI agents as a
first-class, permissioned interface, not as screen scraping. Design is a later roadmap milestone.

## D4 Hardware scope: everything, behind a HAL and one driver model — Decided
Every CPU architecture, GPU, device type and driver, all written by us. Therefore:
- the kernel core is architecture-independent; architecture code lives only in the HAL, one
  module per architecture (`hal/src/arch/<arch>/`);
- drivers sit behind one common driver model (`drivers/`), reaching hardware only through
  register/bus access traits, so the same driver serves every architecture;
- every supported architecture boots in QEMU in automated tests.

## D5 License: MIT, clean-room — Decided
All code is MIT. Never copy or translate GPL/LGPL/copyleft code (including Linux, GPL-2.0);
implement from public specifications, datasheets, man pages and observed behaviour.

## D6 Repository layout: a Cargo workspace of four crates — Decided by the build loop (engineering)
- `kernel/` (`eggos-kernel`): architecture-independent core (library, host-testable) plus the
  kernel binary (a stub on the host so `cargo build` works on every development machine).
- `hal/` (`eggos-hal`): the `Platform` trait the core uses, and one module per architecture.
- `drivers/` (`eggos-drivers`): device drivers, generic over register-access traits.
- `xtask/`: developer commands in Rust (`cargo xtask ...`), so macOS, Windows, Linux and CI run
  the same steps without shell scripts.
The core is generic over `P: Platform` (zero-sized types, associated functions), so the
abstraction costs nothing at run time: every call is monomorphised and inlined.

## D7 Toolchain: pinned stable Rust, no nightly — Decided by the build loop (engineering)
`rust-toolchain.toml` pins an exact stable release so every host and CI use the same compiler
and lints. Bare-metal targets are official tier-2 targets with a prebuilt `core`, so no nightly
and no `build-std` are needed yet. Revisit only if the kernel genuinely needs a nightly feature.

## D8 CI: one cheap Linux job — Decided by the build loop (engineering, per billing rules)
A single `ubuntu-latest` job runs fmt → clippy → build → host tests → QEMU boot tests (from M1,
when the first architecture boots), cheapest first, with `timeout-minutes`, PR-only
cancellation of superseded runs, `fetch-depth: 1` and a cargo cache. Docs-only changes are skipped with `paths-ignore`; if CI ever becomes a *required*
check, replace that with an in-job changed-files gate so docs PRs do not hang pending.
No macOS or Windows runners without the owner's OK; the xtask commands keep those hosts
supported locally.

## D9 Bring-up order: aarch64 and riscv64 first, x86_64 next — Decided by the build loop (engineering)
QEMU's `virt` machines for aarch64 and riscv64 load an ELF kernel directly and start it in the
kernel's privilege level (EL1 / S-mode under OpenSBI) with a UART at a fixed address, so the
first boot needs only a few lines of entry assembly. Together they cover phones, tablets,
Apple-silicon-class laptops, Arm servers and the growing RISC-V embedded/server space.
x86_64 (most desktops, laptops and servers) comes right after: QEMU's `-kernel` enters x86
kernels through Multiboot in 32-bit protected mode, so it needs a 32→64-bit trampoline with
early page tables — a self-contained next step through the same HAL interface.

## D10 AArch64 kernel target is `aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat` — Decided by the build loop (engineering)
The kernel does not use FP/SIMD registers, so traps and context switches never save them for
kernel code (user FP state is saved lazily, later), and early boot works before FP is enabled.
The target also implies `strict-align`, which is required while the MMU is off (all memory is
Device memory). Hot paths that benefit from SIMD (e.g. memcpy, checksums, crypto) will opt in
explicitly in a dedicated, benchmarked module.

## D11 Boot tests: console verdict marker plus real power-off — Decided by the build loop (engineering)
The kernel prints `EGGOS-SELFTEST: PASS` (or `FAIL`, also on panic) and, when built with the
`qemu-test` feature, powers off through each architecture's standard firmware interface (PSCI
`SYSTEM_OFF` on Arm, SBI System Reset on RISC-V) rather than a QEMU-only debug device. The
runner (`cargo xtask qemu`) passes only on a clean QEMU exit within 30 s **and** the pass marker
on its own line **and** no fail marker. This keeps one verdict mechanism for every architecture
and exercises the same power-off path real hardware will use. Without `qemu-test` the kernel
stays up (halts) after boot.

## D12 Board addresses hard-coded until device-tree discovery — Provisional (engineering, until M5)
The early consoles use QEMU `virt`'s UART addresses (PL011 at `0x0900_0000`, NS16550 at
`0x1000_0000`). The driver model milestone (M5) replaces them with discovery from the device
tree the firmware passes (`a1` on RISC-V, `x0` with a Linux-style boot on Arm) and ACPI on x86.

## D13 Performance target: the fastest OS — Decided
EggOS must beat macOS, Windows and Linux on boot time, latency, throughput and memory footprint on
the same hardware, and run foreign apps at least as fast as their native OS. Every hot path gets a
benchmark when it is written, PRs touching one report before/after numbers, and a performance
regression blocks merge unless the owner explicitly accepts it. Release builds (LTO, one codegen
unit) are what we measure and ship. See CLAUDE.md, "The target: the fastest OS".

## D14 Everything written by us, in Rust — Decided
All of EggOS (kernel, drivers, compatibility layers, userland, libraries, tools, build automation)
is Rust we write ourselves. Assembly only where the CPU requires it, inside the HAL's architecture
modules. No third-party crates; a rare exception needs the owner's explicit OK and an entry in
docs/dependencies.md. Machine-provided firmware (UEFI, OpenSBI, QEMU loaders) is outside EggOS.
